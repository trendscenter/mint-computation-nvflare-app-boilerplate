# Computation Author Requirements

## Demonstration of Results
- The computation author must demonstrate that the computation produces meaningful results, such as achieving statistical significance, matching expected outcomes, or aligning with domain-specific benchmarks.

## Integration with COINSTAC GUI
- The computation author must demonstrate that the computation works in the COINSTAC GUI by running without errors, producing expected outputs, and interacting correctly with the GUI components.

## Data Directory Format
- The computation author must specify the format of the data directory to be consumed by the computation, including required files, directory structure, and any schema definitions.

## Parameters Description
- The computation author must describe the computation's accepted parameters and provide examples of valid parameter sets, including edge cases and typical use cases.

## Test Dataset
- The computation author must provide a test dataset that works with the computation and demonstrates its functionality.

## GitHub Repository Requirements
- The repository must be public and accessible to anyone.
- The main branch must be current and capable of building the working image.
- The repository must contain:
  - Data format specification located in a clearly defined section or file.
  - Test data placed in an easily accessible location within the repository.
  - Parameter descriptions and examples included in the documentation, covering a range of valid parameter sets.
